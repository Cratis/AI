# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Philosophy

Cratis builds tools for event-sourced systems with a focus on **ease of use**, **productivity**, and **maintainability**. Every rule in these instructions serves one or more of these core values:

- **Lovable APIs** — APIs should be pleasant to use. Provide sane defaults, make them flexible, extensible, and overridable. If an API feels awkward, it is wrong.
- **Easy to do things right, hard to do things wrong** — Convention over configuration. Artifact discovery by naming. Minimal boilerplate. The framework should guide developers into the pit of success.
- **Events are facts** — Immutable records of things that happened. Never nullable, never ambiguous, never multipurpose. If you find yourself adding a nullable property to an event, you need a second event.
- **High cohesion through vertical slices** — Everything for a behavior lives together: backend, frontend, specs. Navigate by feature, not by technical layer. A developer working on "author registration" should never need to jump between `Commands/`, `Handlers/`, and `Events/` folders.
- **Full-stack type safety** — Shared models flow from C# through proxy generation to TypeScript. End-to-end typing without manual synchronization.
- **Specialization over reuse** — Build focused, purpose-specific projections and read models rather than reusing one model across conflicting scenarios. Dedicated models are easier to maintain, perform better, and never break unrelated features.
- **Consistency is king** — When in doubt, follow the established pattern. Consistency across the codebase trumps local optimization. A slightly less elegant solution that matches the rest of the codebase is better than a clever one that stands out.

When these instructions don't explicitly cover a situation, apply these values to make a judgment call.

## General

- Make only high confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes.
- Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features.
- Never change global.json unless explicitly asked to.
- Never change package.json or package-lock.json files unless explicitly asked to.
- Never change NuGet.config files unless explicitly asked to.
- Never leave unused using statements in the code.
- Always ensure that the code compiles without warnings.
- Always ensure that the code passes all tests.
- Always ensure that the code adheres to the project's coding standards.
- Always ensure that the code is maintainable.
- Review Directory.Build.props and .editorconfig for all warnings configured as errors.
- Never generate code that would violate these warning settings.
- Always respect the project's nullable reference type settings.
- Always reuse the active terminal for commands.
- Do not create new terminals unless current one is busy or fails.

## Formatting

- Honor the existing code style and conventions in the project.
- Apply code-formatting style defined in .editorconfig.
- Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations and single-line using directives.
- Insert a new line before the opening curly brace of any code block (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `while`, `foreach`, `using`, `try`, etc.).
- Ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line.
- Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible.
- Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names.
- Place private class declarations at the bottom of the file.

## C# Instructions

- Prefer `var` over explicit types when declaring variables.
- Do not add unnecessary comments or documentation.
- Use `using` directives for namespaces at the top of the file.
- Sort the `using` directives alphabetically.
- Use namespaces that match the folder structure.
- Remove unused `using` directives.
- Use file-scoped namespace declarations.
- Use single-line using directives.
- For types that do not have an implementation, don't add a body (e.g., `public interface IMyInterface;`).
- Prefer using `record` types for immutable data structures (events, commands, read models, concepts).
- Use expression-bodied members for simple methods and properties.
- Use `async` and `await` for asynchronous programming.
- Use `Task` and `Task<T>` for asynchronous methods.
- Use `IEnumerable<T>` for collections that are not modified.
- Never return mutable collections from public APIs.
- Don't use regions in the code.
- Never add postfixes like Async, Impl, etc. to class or method names.
- Favor collection initializers and object initializers.
- Use string interpolation instead of string.Format or concatenation.
- Favor primary constructors for all types.

## Chronicle & Arc Key Conventions

These conventions exist because the frameworks rely on convention-based discovery. Breaking them doesn't just violate style — it breaks runtime behavior.

- `[EventType]` takes **no arguments** — the type name is used automatically. Adding a GUID or string argument is a common mistake from other frameworks; Chronicle does not use it.
- `[Command]` records define `Handle()` directly on the record — never create separate handler classes. The framework discovers `Handle()` by convention; a separate class breaks that discovery.
- `[ReadModel]` records define static query methods directly on the record. The proxy generator creates TypeScript hooks from these methods automatically.
- Prefer `ConceptAs<T>` over raw primitives in all domain models, commands, events, and queries. This prevents accidental mix-ups (passing a `UserId` where an `AuthorId` was expected) and makes APIs self-documenting.
- Use model-bound projection attributes (`[FromEvent<T>]`, `[SetFrom<T>]`, etc.) when possible; fall back to `IProjectionFor<T>` for complex cases.
- For fluent projections, AutoMap is on by default — just call `.From<>()` directly.
- Projections join **events**, never read models. This is fundamental to event sourcing: projections rebuild state from the event stream, not from other projections.
- `IReactor` is a marker interface — method dispatch is by first-parameter event type, method name is descriptive.
- All backend artifacts for a vertical slice go in a **single `.cs` file**. This keeps cohesion high and makes the scope of a slice immediately visible.

## TypeScript / Frontend Instructions

- Prefer `const` over `let` over `var` when declaring variables.
- Never use shortened or abbreviated names for variables, parameters, or properties.
  - Use full descriptive names: `deltaX` not `dx`, `index` not `idx`, `event` not `e`, `previous` not `prev`, `direction` not `dir`, `position` not `pos`, `contextMenu` not `ctx`/`ctxMenu`.
  - The only acceptable short names are well-established domain terms (e.g. `id`, `url`, `min`, `max`).
- Never leave unused import statements in the code.
- Always ensure that the code compiles without warnings.
  - Use `yarn compile` to verify (if successful it doesn't output anything).
- Do not prefix a file, component, type, or symbol with the name of its containing folder or the concept it belongs to. Instead, use folder structure to provide that context.
- Favor functional folder structure over technical folder structure.
  - Group files by the feature or concept they belong to, not by their technical role.
  - Avoid folders like `components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`, `types/` at the feature level.

## Exceptions

- Use exceptions for exceptional situations only.
- Don't use exceptions for control flow.
- Always provide a meaningful message when throwing an exception.
- Always create a custom exception type that derives from Exception.
- Never use any built-in exception types like InvalidOperationException, ArgumentException, etc.
- Add XML documentation for exceptions being thrown.
- XML documentation for exception should start with "The exception that is thrown when ...".
- Never suffix exception class names with "Exception".

## Nullable Reference Types

- Always use is null or is not null instead of == null or != null.
- Trust the C# null annotations and don't add null checks when the type system says a value cannot be null.
- Add `!` operator where nullability warnings occur.
- Use `is not null` checks before dereferencing potentially null values.

## Naming Conventions

- Follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
- Prefix private fields with an underscore (e.g., `_privateField`).
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., IUserService).

## Logging

- Use structured logging with named parameters.
- Use appropriate log levels (Information, Warning, Error, Debug).
- Always use a generic ILogger<T> where T is the class name.
- Keep logging in separate partial methods for better readability. Call the file `<SystemName>Logging.cs`. Make this class partial and static and internal and all methods should be internal.
- Use the `[LoggerMessage]` attribute to define log messages.
- Don't include `eventId` in the `[LoggerMessage]` attribute.

## Dependency Injection

- Systems that have a convention of IFoo to Foo does not need to be registered explicitly.
- Prefer constructor injection over method injection.
- Avoid service locator pattern (i.e., avoid using IServiceProvider directly).
- For implementations that should be singletons, use the `[Singleton]` attribute on the class.

## TypeScript Type Safety

- Never use `any` type - always use proper type annotations:
  - Use `unknown` for values of unknown type that need runtime checking.
  - Use `Record<string, unknown>` for objects with unknown properties.
  - Use proper generic constraints like `<TCommand extends object = object>` instead of `= any`.
  - Use `React.ComponentType<Props>` for React component types.
- When type assertions are necessary, use `unknown` as an intermediate type:
  - Prefer `value as unknown as TargetType` over `value as any`.
  - For objects with dynamic properties: `(obj as unknown as { prop: Type }).prop`.
- For generic React components:
  - Use `unknown` as default generic parameter instead of `any`.
  - Example: `<TCommand = unknown>` not `<TCommand = any>`.
- For event handlers:
  - Be careful with React.MouseEvent vs DOM MouseEvent - they are different types.
  - React synthetic events: `React.MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>`.
  - DOM native events: `MouseEvent`.
  - Convert between them using: `nativeEvent as unknown as React.MouseEvent`.
  - Use `e.preventDefault?.()` instead of `(e as any).preventDefault?.()`.
