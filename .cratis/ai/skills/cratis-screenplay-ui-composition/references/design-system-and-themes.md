Requires a Screenplay release that carries design systems (6.3.0 or later; check `screenplay --version`). Earlier compilers reject `design system` and a `theme` with `implements`. The `ui profile` that selects a theme and the shell are in [ui-profile-and-theme.md](ui-profile-and-theme.md).

## The split: design system, theme, profile

| Construct | Role | How many |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `design system` | The contract: modes, tokens and what each is for, components built from tokens, words, contrast rules. No values. | Exactly one per application (a second is `PLAY0917`) |
| `theme ... implements` | An implementation: palette, token values, per-mode values. Never redefines components. | Several; one is the design system's `default theme` |
| `ui profile` | Picks a theme with `theme <Name>`; without one it is drawn in the `default theme`. `appearance` keeps only `color scheme`, which picks the mode. | One per target |

A theme with only `compatible with` lines and no `implements` is a compatibility-only theme and keeps working; a profile may select it only when the application declares no design system.

## A design system and its default theme

```screenplay
design system ShopDesign
  modes light, dark
  default theme Daylight

  tokens
    color
      surface    "page background"
      text       "body text"
      primary    "primary action"
      on-primary "text on a primary action"
    space
      md         "default gap between elements"
    radius
      control    "inputs and buttons"
    font
      sans       "interface text"

  components
    Button
      parts text, background, radius
      variant primary
        text       = color.on-primary
        background = color.primary
        radius     = radius.control
        state disabled
          text       = color.text
          background = color.surface

  words
    voice
      tone = "Plain and exact"
    naming
      customer = "Client"

  rules
    contrast text on background at least 4.5

theme Daylight
  implements ShopDesign
  compatible with core

  palette
    indigo = "#4338CA"
    white  = "#FFFFFF"
    ink    = "#111827"

  values
    space.md       = "12px"
    radius.control = "8px"
    font.sans      = "inter"

  light
    color.surface    = palette.white
    color.text       = palette.ink
    color.primary    = palette.indigo
    color.on-primary = palette.white

  dark
    color.surface    = palette.ink
    color.text       = palette.white
    color.primary    = palette.indigo
    color.on-primary = palette.white
```

- `default theme` is required (`PLAY0927`): a profile without a `theme` line resolves to it.
- A theme assigns every `color` token a value in every mode, from `values` or from the mode block (`PLAY0921`). Other categories need a value where a component uses the token (`PLAY0922`).
- A value is a quoted literal, `palette.<name>` or another token (`<category>.<name>`). Reference loops are `PLAY0923`.

## Tokens, components, words and rules

- Categories are closed: `color`, `space`, `size`, `radius`, `border`, `shadow`, `font`, `type`, `motion`, `opacity`, `z` (anything else is `PLAY0916`). A token is `<name> "<what it is for>"`; the description is the contract a theme author reads. Address a token as `<category>.<name>`.
- A component declares `parts` from `text`, `background`, `border`, `radius`, `height`, `padding`, `shadow`, `font`, then `variant`s assigning each part one token of a category the part takes (`background = space.md` is `PLAY0924`). `state` (`default`, `hover`, `focus`, `active`, `disabled`, `selected`) overrides only what changes.
- `words` holds `voice` and `naming` as `<key> = "<text>"` lines, once each; they travel with the design system.
- The one rule form is `contrast <part> on <part> at least <ratio>`. The compiler checks it for every theme, mode, variant and state except `disabled`, and warns `PLAY0928` naming the pair. Only hex and `rgb(...)` colors are measured; a named color is not checked.
- Modes belong to the design system, never to a theme; a mode block for an undeclared mode is `PLAY0918`.

## A second theme and a profile that selects it

```screenplay
design system ShopDesign
  modes light, dark
  default theme Daylight

  tokens
    color
      surface    "page background"
      text       "body text"
      primary    "primary action"
      on-primary "text on a primary action"
    space
      md         "default gap between elements"
    radius
      control    "inputs and buttons"
    font
      sans       "interface text"

  components
    Button
      parts text, background, radius
      variant primary
        text       = color.on-primary
        background = color.primary
        radius     = radius.control
        state disabled
          text       = color.text
          background = color.surface

  words
    voice
      tone = "Plain and exact"
    naming
      customer = "Client"

  rules
    contrast text on background at least 4.5

theme Daylight
  implements ShopDesign
  compatible with core

  palette
    indigo = "#4338CA"
    white  = "#FFFFFF"
    ink    = "#111827"

  values
    space.md       = "12px"
    radius.control = "8px"
    font.sans      = "inter"

  light
    color.surface    = palette.white
    color.text       = palette.ink
    color.primary    = palette.indigo
    color.on-primary = palette.white

  dark
    color.surface    = palette.ink
    color.text       = palette.white
    color.primary    = palette.indigo
    color.on-primary = palette.white

theme Square
  implements ShopDesign

  palette
    indigo = "#4338CA"
    white  = "#FFFFFF"
    ink    = "#111827"

  values
    space.md       = "12px"
    radius.control = "0px"
    font.sans      = "inter"

  light
    color.surface    = palette.white
    color.text       = palette.ink
    color.primary    = palette.indigo
    color.on-primary = palette.white

  dark
    color.surface    = palette.ink
    color.text       = palette.white
    color.primary    = palette.indigo
    color.on-primary = palette.white

ui profile Desktop
  target platform web
  appearance
    color scheme dark

ui profile Compact
  target platform web
  theme Square
  appearance
    color scheme light
```

`Desktop` has no `theme` line, so it gets `Daylight` (the default) in the `dark` mode. `Compact` overrides with `Square` and draws in `light`. The selected theme must implement the application's design system (`PLAY0926`). With no `color scheme`, or one that is not a mode (`system`), the first mode is used.

## Which theme and mode a profile gets

`DesignSystemResolver` in `Cratis.Screenplay.Design` offers `SelectTheme`, `SelectMode` and `Resolve(application, profile)`; the result is a flat `<category>.<name>` map with palette and token references followed, plus each component's variants and states merged over the variant's parts. A host reads that, not the syntax.

## Deprecated `appearance` members

`appearance` keeps only `color scheme`. `accent`, `corners` and `font` still read but warn `PLAY0929`; move the value into the theme:

| Was in `appearance` | Becomes, in the theme |
| --- | --- |
| `accent "#4F46E5"` | a `color` token value, such as `color.primary = "#4F46E5"` |
| `corners round` | a `radius` token value, such as `radius.control = "8px"` |
| `font inter` | a `font` token value, such as `font.sans = "inter"` |

Do not carry raw colors, radii or fonts in a profile: declare the token in the design system and give it a value in each theme.

## Diagnostics

| Code | Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PLAY0916` | Error | Malformed `design system`: unknown section, token category, component part or state, bad line, a part the component does not declare, or a section twice. |
| `PLAY0917` | Error | A second `design system`. |
| `PLAY0918` | Error | A theme block for a mode the design system does not declare. |
| `PLAY0919` | Error | A mode, token, component, variant, part, palette entry, value or word declared twice. |
| `PLAY0920` | Error | A theme assigns a token the design system does not declare. |
| `PLAY0921` | Error | An implementing theme gives a `color` token no value in a declared mode. |
| `PLAY0922` | Error | A design reference names something undeclared, or a token with no value. |
| `PLAY0923` | Error | Design references loop. |
| `PLAY0924` | Error | A part takes a token of a category it cannot take. |
| `PLAY0925` | Error | A theme `implements` an undeclared design system. |
| `PLAY0926` | Error | A profile selects a theme that does not implement the design system. |
| `PLAY0927` | Error | No `default theme`, or it is undeclared or does not implement the design system. |
| `PLAY0928` | Warning | A theme and mode resolve a text/background pair below a `contrast` rule (`disabled` not checked). |
| `PLAY0929` | Warning | `accent`, `corners` or `font` in `appearance` is deprecated. |
| `PLAY0930` | Error | A theme's `implements`, `palette`, `values` or mode block is malformed or repeated. |

The executable semantic model defers the design system as UI configuration (`PLAY0269` on binding); it is not an error.

## Reading and editing the design

The MCP `ui-profiles` read tool (no new tool) also returns the design system, every theme with its palette, values and per-mode values, each theme's resolved tokens and components per mode, the theme and mode each profile resolves to (`resolvedTheme`), the diagnostics `PLAY0916` to `PLAY0930` and the closed vocabulary of categories, parts and states. Edit with `propose-ast` on `DesignSystemSyntax`, `DesignTokenCategorySyntax`, `DesignTokenSyntax`, `DesignComponentSyntax`, `DesignVariantSyntax`, `DesignStateSyntax`, `DesignAssignmentSyntax`, `DesignWordsSyntax`, `DesignContrastRuleSyntax`, `ThemeModeValuesSyntax` and `ThemeSyntax` (`implements`, `palette`, `values`, `modeValues`); the compiler refuses an invalid edit with its code.

## Checklist

- [ ] One `design system` with a `default theme`; each selected theme implements it and sets every `color` token in each mode; no profile carries `accent`, `corners` or `font`.
