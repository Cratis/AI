A command with an authorization gate, a validation rule and a uniqueness
constraint, and a read model fed by its event. The `for` values select ESM v2.

- Inline events are ordinary named facts in `given` and `then`. Assert their
  destination with `for`, not a payload identifier; inline declaration does not
  change fixture or assertion syntax.
- `RejectingANumberAnotherInvoiceHolds` needs `for`: without it the `given`
  event lands on the command's own event source, and re-claiming your own value
  is not a violation.
- `ProjectingAnAppendedInvoice` exercises the projection without running the
  command. A `when append` specification may sit in a `StateView` slice, even for an
  event another slice declares, as long as the event's producer gives it one
  unambiguous destination type (binding resolves it from commands in other slices);
  otherwise `for` fails with `PLAY0273`. Only `when <Command>` needs the command's
  own slice.
- `LookingUpAnExistingInvoice` performs the query as its action. It binds to
  exactly what `then query` with `arguments` and `result` would, so on a version
  before v4.48.0 write it that way instead.
