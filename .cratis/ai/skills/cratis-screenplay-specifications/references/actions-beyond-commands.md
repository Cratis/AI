## Actions beyond commands

A slice is not always set off by a command. Name what does:

| Slice | Action |
| --- | --- |
| A view no event builds - its query has a `performer` | `given readmodel` …, `when query <Query>`, `then result` / `then no result` |
| An automation driven by the clock | `given clock "<instant>"`, `when clock "<later instant>"` |
| An automation driven by an application trigger | `when trigger <Trigger>` with the values it carries |
| A translation driven by a capture | `given capture <Capture>` (the record as it was), `when capture <Capture>` (as it is now) |

Use `given clock`, never `given time`, to state the scenario occurrence time and
assert a value mapped from `$context.occurred`. In a command's `produces`, that
mapping executes when the scenario has `given clock`. It is not the same as
`$eventContext.occurred` in a projection, which the execution plan refuses (below).

**Which tools bind these actions** (probed: `screenplay mcp` 4.66.0 and `cratis screenplay mcp` 3.28.2
report the complete example below `executableReady` with no executable error, in
`open-workspace` readiness and `read-workspace` view `executable-diagnostics`;
`cratis` before 3.28.2 bundled 4.60.1 and did not):

- **Screenplay 4.66.0 (ESM v6, from 4.61.0), standalone and `cratis` 3.28.2:** the clock, trigger
  and capture actions, and the `Automation` and `Translate` slices, reactions and
  captures they drive, bind. The reference runner executes them as library code, with
  the semantics in [Reactions and cascades](reactions-and-cascades.md).
- **`cratis` before 3.28.2 (Screenplay 4.60.1, ESM v1-v5):**
  **`when query` executed. The clock, trigger and capture actions did not.** They parsed, printed and were
  checked against the application, but binding reported `PLAY0268` naming the
  proposed ESM v6 (decision 0022), and an `Automation` or `Translate` slice reported
  *is not admitted by ESM v1*. Only binding showed this: `cratis screenplay validate`
  does not bind, so it stayed green.

Write the actions either way - they state what sets the slice off. Report each as
bound and not executed, or as parsed only, naming the tool that said so.
