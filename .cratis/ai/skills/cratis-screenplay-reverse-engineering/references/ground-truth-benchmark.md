# Ground-truth fidelity benchmark

Measures how closely a model rebuilt from observation matches an application whose own model is
known. Use it to judge a skill change: run the same app and the same inputs before and after, and
compare two scores. It needs an application you own, with its original model and source.

## Behavior first

Score what the rebuilt model does, not what it is called. Build a behavior catalog of the original's
rules, rejections, flows and time rules and mark each item expressed, partial or missing in the
model, and pass or fail where its probe ran on the rebuilt app
([behavior-catalog.md](behavior-catalog.md)). The name inventory below is a separate, secondary
score.

## Rubric (names)

Compare the rebuilt model with the original, category by category, as an inventory: each original
item is exact, renamed, partial or missing; each rebuilt item with no original is extra.

| Category | Weight | Counted |
|---|---|---|
| Commands | .20 | names and fields |
| Events | .15 | names and fields |
| Read models and queries | .15 | fields, and queries |
| Screens | .15 | screens and their actions |
| Constraints and validation | .15 | rules on commands and concepts |
| Concepts | .10 | concept types |
| Specifications | .03 | scenarios |
| Hand-written rules | .07 | rules that live in code, not in the model |

Per category report recall (original items found) and precision (rebuilt items that exist in the
original). Score a category as `(structural exact + 0.5 x partial) / original items`; use recall
alone where precision is 1. Structural match compares names and base types; strict match also
compares concept types. Fidelity is `sum(weight x score)`.

## Scores

Three scores carry the result; quote only these:

- **Behavior** (primary): the catalog score, model read and executed.
- **Structure (legacy)**: commands, events, read models, screens and concepts, by the formula and
  weights above, kept so results stay comparable with earlier runs. **Rules (legacy)**
  (constraints, hand-written rules, specifications) is quoted only for that comparison; it is a
  name-based score, not the behavior score.
- **Naming (non-leaked)**: the inventory score without names the original serves verbatim or the
  assemblies restate. Quote **Naming (all)** only with the leak share; in an earlier run most
  exact matches were leaked.

A model often gets the names right and the behavior wrong or missing; the split shows it.

## Procedure

1. **Blind run.** The runner rebuilds the model from the running app and its allowed inputs, with
   the original model and source hidden from it.
   Blind-run hygiene: the run under test never reads prior scoring, fidelity reports or the
   original model or catalog before its own model is final. Artifacts the original serves that restate its
   model (for a Stage/Arc original: the served scene and generated proxies) are excluded, or
   recorded as a separate evidence class and reported, because they inflate structure scores.
2. **Build the catalog** from the original first (assemblies or source), then **compare** on
   read-only copies of both models and the source; run `scripts/score-fidelity.mjs` on the filled
   catalog and naming inventory. Read the generated source for
   behavior ground truth. Do not re-run the rebuilt model's own checks as part of the scoring.
3. **Classify quirks** (below) before counting a difference against the skill.
4. **Rerun after each skill change** on the same app with the same inputs and weights. If a change
   alters the weights or categories, change this rubric in the same edit.
5. **Record** the full result in the lane's untracked `.ai-work/` folder; quote only the three
   scores in an issue or pull request. Scores never enter the corpus.

## Quirk classification

Mark each difference as one of:

- **original defect**: the original behaves oddly and the rebuild copied what was observed;
  the catalog item states the observed behavior, so the copy scores as expressed.
- **misreading**: the rebuild read the evidence wrongly or invented a rule.
- **correct**: the rebuild is right and the original model differs only in form.

Only misreadings and missing items count against the skill.

## Regression-suite convention

Each platform issue found by a benchmark app (in Screenplay or Stage) gets a minimal model that
should validate and run once the issue is fixed, kept with that issue. This reference names the
convention only; it does not claim a tracked suite.
