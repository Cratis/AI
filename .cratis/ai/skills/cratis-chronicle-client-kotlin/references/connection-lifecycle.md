## Connection lifecycle

- **Keepalive is two-way.** The kernel pushes a keep-alive down the `Connect`
  stream and the client answers with a separate unary `connectionKeepAlive` RPC
  (`connection/ConnectionManager.kt:30`). A watchdog checks every
  `WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS = 1_000L` and treats a gap longer than
  `KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS = 5_000L` as a lost connection (`:126-128`, `:164`,
  `:171`). **Silence, not an error, is how the connection dies** — nothing throws.
- Reconnect is an infinite loop with jittered exponential backoff, base 1s,
  capped at 30s, re-resolving DNS/SRV on every attempt
  (`ConnectionManager.kt:75-101`, `:155-158`).
- The client identifies itself to the kernel as `"Kotlin"`
  (`ConnectionManager.kt:161`).
- `dispose()` cancels the connection manager, shuts the channel down with a
  5-second `awaitTermination`, then `shutdownNow`
  (`connection/ChronicleConnection.kt:116-125`).
- **Your process must stay alive** for reactors and reducers to keep receiving —
  observation is a live gRPC stream, and each observer runs on its own
  `CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO)` (`observation/ReactorsService.kt:57`,
  `observation/ReducersService.kt:59`).
