# Specifying triggers and the clock

**Specify what sets them off** (v4.48.0, checked at tag `v4.48.0`, commit
`3baf4a4`; execution from ESM v6, checked at `v4.66.0`): `when clock "<instant>"`
for a reaction on `every` or `at`, `when trigger <Trigger>` with its values for one
on an application trigger, and `given capture` / `when capture <Capture>` with the
source record's fields for a capture, then the events that should follow.
`given clock` fixes the occurrence time, so values mapped from `$context.occurred`
can be asserted. Excerpt of the complete example below:

```screenplay excerpt
specification IssuingTheWeeklyDigest
  given clock "2026-10-05T07:00:00Z"
  when clock "2026-10-05T07:30:00Z"
  then DigestIssued
    for "weekly"
    issuedAt = "2026-10-05T07:30:00Z"
```

Under `cratis` before 3.28.2 these actions parsed and were checked against the application
but bound to nothing (`PLAY0268` names ESM v6, decision 0022); on 3.28.2 they bind. Either way
no command runs them: report such a specification as authored, not executed. Clock rules: the clock is UTC and exact; an
occurrence fires once when it is **due after `given clock` and at or before
`when clock`**, in time order; intervals count from the Unix epoch; `when clock`
needs `given clock`, so equal instants fire nothing. Limits: 10,000 occurrences per
advance, 1,000 new facts per scenario. Spec grammar and outcome comparison:
`cratis-screenplay-specifications`.
