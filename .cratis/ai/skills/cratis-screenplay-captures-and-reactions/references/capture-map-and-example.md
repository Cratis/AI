## Capture `map`

**`map`** reshapes before events are appended: direct rename
(`productName = name`), a backtick template, `translate` with indented
`"source" => target` entries, and `split <source> by "<sep>"` with indented target
properties.

**Mapping sources:** `$.` for a value from the current source item, `$context.` for
capture context, `$env.` for an environment variable, plus literals and templates.
