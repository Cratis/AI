# Event modeling with Screenplay (start here)

Event Modeling is the **method**: walk a business process left to right and write
down every behavior as a command that changes the system, a view that reads it,
an automation that runs off it, or a translation of outside data. Screenplay is
the **artifact**: one language that holds that whole model - concepts, commands,
events, read models, queries, screens, specifications - in files that compile.

You are a **facilitator, not a stenographer.** Ask probing questions. Challenge
assumptions. Keep asking *"and then what happens?"* after every event, every
command, every answer. Use business language. Do not discuss databases, APIs, or
frameworks during modeling.

**Ask only what the step needs.** Missing or ambiguous information: ask, one question that
changes the model most, and follow a vague answer ("it depends", "usually") with "what decides
it?". Already known: do not ask. Told not to stop for questions (an unattended run): assume the
most reasonable answer, say so visibly where it can be corrected, never guess silently. Assume
visibly during modeling; delivery blocks any guess that could encode a wrong rule, authorization,
money or time behavior. Contradictions, a third review round, a gate only the user can accept,
and approvals not yet given always stop
(`cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`, `references/stop-or-assume.md`). Read `cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`'s `references/stop-or-assume.md` when information is missing or contradictory, or when deciding whether unattended work may proceed.

**Do not cut corners to save tokens or effort.** A rule that needs more slices, events, views,
translation steps or specifications gets them written; budget is never a reason to delete a
modeled behavior, label a gap "accepted debt" or merge translating outside data into our facts
into the work that acts on them. Flag a real trade-off to the user instead of resolving it by cutting the model
(`cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`, `references/completeness-self-check.md`). Read `cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`'s `references/completeness-self-check.md` before every gate and whenever effort or token cost tempts a reduction in modeled behavior.

## Start here

**1. Decide the level (short form; master copy in `cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`).**
Check first that the method skills are installed; installing them never opts a
repository in. The work is **model-first** only in an opted-in repository: the model
root (the folder holding the project's `.play` files) holds a committed `.play` file (`git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD` lists a `.play` file there, narrowed to `-- <root>` when a root is configured), or the project explicitly set
`mcpServers.screenplay.root` in `.cratis/ai.json`. An empty directory, install output,
an installed skill, a `.play` file outside the root or an untracked or uncommitted draft is not
opt-in; staged or untracked files under the root are drafts. A committed file with uncommitted
working-tree edits is a model change in progress; its HEAD version is the contract until the
change is committed. A behavior is a contract only when an accepted model under the root covers it.
Otherwise stay code-first. Only the entry-point session proposes a model (at most once
per session, never for trivial, bug-fix, infrastructure, client, framework or
brownfield-maintenance work; unattended: record the recommendation in the final report).
Framework repositories and brownfield work that has not opted in stay code-first.

- **Model:** change the `.play`, verify, review, then render or gap-fill.
- **Code is right for** infrastructure, clients, Screenplay code attachments and
  handlers, adapters, and scope Stage cannot render yet (the model stays the contract).
- **Never:** use code as a shortcut around the model; change the model to match
  existing code; edit Stage-managed output; leave a modeled rule living only in
  code; weaken protection (authorization, `@pii`, rules) so a model compiles or renders.

**2. Run the lifecycle.** Load `cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle` for modes, the
independent verdicts V1-V5, the P0-P9 phases with their gates, stop-or-assume,
identity ownership and handoffs. Then load **one** phase skill. Small changes enter
at the phase where they belong and run the downstream gates for the changed scope.

**3. Pick the phase skill.**

| Phase | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| P0-P1 intake, timeline, personas, events | `cratis-screenplay-discovery` |
| P2 commands, read models, screens, field lineage | `cratis-screenplay-slice-design` |
| P2 stream identity, consistency, evolution | `cratis-screenplay-streams-and-consistency` |
| P2 reactions, work queues, clocks, captures | `cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations` |
| P3 specifications and coverage | `cratis-screenplay-scenario-coverage` |
| P4-P5 self-check and independent review | `cratis-screenplay-model-review` |
| Existing system into a model (replaces P1-P2) | `cratis-screenplay-legacy-extraction` |
| P7-P9 execute, render, fall back, verify | `cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill` |
| Tools, versions, verdict commands, diagnostics | `cratis-screenplay-toolchain` |

**4. Nine steps to phase skill.** [references/nine-steps.md](references/nine-steps.md)
keeps the activities, Screenplay output and facilitation questions of each step:

| Step | Activity | Phase skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-3 | Goal, brainstorm events, order them | `cratis-screenplay-discovery` |
| 4-6 | Wireframes, commands, read models | `cratis-screenplay-slice-design` |
| 7-8 | Automations, external integrations | `cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations` |
| 9 | Decompose into vertical slices | `cratis-screenplay-slice-design` |
| after 9 | Specifications, then review | `cratis-screenplay-scenario-coverage`, `cratis-screenplay-model-review` |

Read [references/nine-steps.md](references/nine-steps.md) when facilitating a workflow and needing a step's activities, required output, or questions. Read [references/invoicing-example.md](references/invoicing-example.md) when you need a complete worked `.play` document (RegisterInvoice command and InvoiceList view) to copy the shape from.


## Verify

```shell
screenplay <model-folder> --warnaserror
```

(The standalone tool; `cratis screenplay validate <model-folder> --warnings-as-errors`
is the fallback, and neither names the other's verdict. Versions and commands:
`cratis-screenplay-toolchain`.)

- [ ] Zero errors **and zero warnings**. An unrecognized construct inside a slice
      is only a warning (`PLAY0029`) and its block is **silently dropped** - a typo
      can delete a whole projection while the exit code stays `0`.
- [ ] Every behavior is exactly one slice type, and the whole model validates
      against the eight Quick gate checks.
- [ ] Every event is past tense, single-purpose, and carries no event-source id.
- [ ] Personal data is classified on the `concept`, with a reason.
- [ ] Specifications name the rejections, not only the happy path.
- [ ] If the model must reach a runtime, check it binds with the tool that will
      consume it. The standalone 4.68.0 binder admits Automation and Translate slices
      (ESM v6) and generated values and responses (ESM v7); Stage 4.24.0 admits ESM v1 to v3 (4.24.2: v1 to v4, evolved events refused with `STAGE-ESM-026`) and renders only `StateChange` and
      `StateView` slices, so automations and translations are gap-fill there.

## Parsed is not runnable

The compiler accepts far more than anything executes. Between the syntax tree and
any runtime sits the **executable semantic model (ESM)**, and it fails closed:
what it cannot represent reports `PLAY0268` or `PLAY0271` and the model does not
bind. Keep four states apart when you report on a model: **parsed** (the
`screenplay` tool), **bound** (ESM), **reference-executed** (specifications pass
the reference runner) and **target-executed** (Stage or a rendered application).
The independent verdicts V1 to V5 that report them are in
`cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`.

What binds depends on **which tool** you ask, so name the tool and its version:

- `Automation` and `Translate` slices, reactions, captures and triggers: the
  standalone `screenplay` 4.66.0 or later and the `cratis` 3.28.2 bundle (4.66.0) bind them (ESM v6).
  The `cratis` 3.27.1 bundle (Screenplay 4.60.1) reported *Slice '<name>' of type '<type>'
  is not admitted by ESM v1.* Stage 4.24.2 admits only ESM v1 to v4 and renders none of them.
- `reads` and `concurrency` on a command do not bind (`PLAY0271`), so no decision is
  protected against stale state. A reaction trigger's `reads` that only `invokes` is
  report-only intent (`PLAY0270`); one that `produces` directly fails binding (`PLAY0268`).
- `persona` declarations are report-only and never block; `@pii` and `@sensitive`
  concepts do block binding (`PLAY0268`). Keep them anyway: the classification is
  part of the model. Report the block.
- Generated values/responses bind and reference-execute as v7; sources, streams
  and command/specification routes as v8; reaction `runs as` identity as v10 on
  standalone 4.125.0. Use `screenplay test` or MCP `run-specifications` for V4.
  Operations/systems, exact numbers and refusal/redelivery remain unadmitted.
  CLI 3.41.0 bundles older syntax and renders through v7 only: its parser rejects
  `runs as`, and Stage refuses generated values/responses with STAGE-ESM-028/029.
  Source/binding admission and target realization are separate gates.

The ESM versions, the full disposition table and the Step 7 clock example's binding
result are in [references/parsed-not-runnable.md](references/parsed-not-runnable.md)
and `cratis-screenplay-toolchain` (`references/executable-subset.md`). Read `references/parsed-not-runnable.md` when determining the required ESM version or interpreting binding dispositions. Read `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`'s `references/executable-subset.md` when checking binder admission or reference-execution limits. Model the wider
language freely when the `.play` file **is** the deliverable - documentation,
review, a shared description of a system. Never read a clean `screenplay` run as
evidence a construct works downstream.

## Locate the model

Look first for the project's existing `.play` files: the folder holding them is the
model. A new model goes under the repository's `Source/` or `src/` folder, else in a
`Screenplay/` folder at the repository root; never under `.cratis/`, which holds
configuration and the shared AI corpus only. This is the
conventional home for consumer-owned `.play` source; do not invent another
location or search the whole repository before checking it.

`cratis ai install` manages `.cratis/ai/`, never model files. Never
hand-copy Screenplay source between repositories. Keep Markdown that explains,
questions or navigates the model in the repository's documentation; the `.play`
source is the single flow model.

## Verified product sources

| Package | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Cratis.Screenplay` | `4.31.0` | Compiler: parser, validator, diagnostics, folder merge, semantic binder |
| `Cratis.Screenplay.Tool` | `4.31.0` | The `screenplay` dotnet tool |
| `Cratis.Screenplay` | main `fd18129` | Inline contracts and event context; changed nine-step examples compiled |
| `Cratis.Screenplay.Tool` | `4.68.0` (`79801bf`) | Current pin: the nine-step examples compile and their specifications run in the reference runner; generated values and responses (ESM v7) were read at this tag |
| `Cratis.Screenplay.Tool` | `4.66.0` (`c89198b`) | Persona, operation and stream dispositions below were read at this tag, and the Step 7 clock example was probed through MCP on it |

The pin set for the whole Screenplay family, and which tool reports what, lives only in
`cratis-screenplay-toolchain` `references/versions.md`. Read `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`'s `references/versions.md` before choosing a tool or reporting a version-dependent verdict. The `fd18129` update follows
`commands.md`, `events.md` and decision 0023 at that main commit (after v4.52.0);
compilation does not establish reference execution. The original baseline was checked at
tag `v4.31.0` (commit `355dffb`): `Documentation/screenplay/{slices,commands,folders,printing,interactions,specifications}.md`,
`projections/keys.md`, and decisions 0001 to 0014. Changed [nine-step examples](references/nine-steps.md)
use the newer commit and the 4.66.0 and 4.68.0 tools; do not attribute them to the old tag.

Read [references/slice-type-rules.md](references/slice-type-rules.md) when deciding if a behavior is an Automation or a Translate slice.

## Two phases - discovery, then design

**Never jump into detailed workflow design without broad domain understanding.** Phase 1
maps the territory (actors, processes, outside systems, the most critical workflow; ask,
do not assume; it lands as `module`, `persona` and `import`; protocol in
`cratis-screenplay-discovery`). Phase 2 designs one workflow at a time through all nine steps
([nine-steps.md](references/nine-steps.md): activities, Screenplay output, questions).

## The prime directive: do not lose information

Store what happened (events), not just current state. Events are immutable
past-tense facts in business language. **Every read-model field must trace back to
an event.** If a field has no source event, something is missing from the model -
it is not an optional column.

## The four patterns -> the four slice types

Every behavior is exactly one. An unknown slice type is a compile error:
*Unknown slice type '<x>' - expected StateChange, StateView, Automation or Translate*.

| Pattern | Slice type | Screenplay constructs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Command -> Event | `StateChange` | `command` -> `produces` -> `event`, plus `validate`, `authorize`, `constraint` |
| Events -> Read Model | `StateView` | `readmodel`, `projection` or `reducer`, `query`, `screen` |
| Event -> decision -> Command/Event | `Automation` | `reaction` |
| External data -> Event | `Translate` | `capture` |

Read [references/parsed-not-runnable.md](references/parsed-not-runnable.md) (section "Decision 0006 and shipped generations") when deciding whether a decided construct (trigger `reads`, event generations) is implemented. An accepted decision is not necessarily implemented.

## Where Cratis diverges from the generic method

Two divergences matter, and getting them wrong produces a model that will not
compile or will not be safe. Both are deliberate.

- **A command may read state.** The generic method forbids `ReadModel -> Command`
  edges. Screenplay ships `reads <ReadModel> [as <alias>] [by <property>]` so the
  model shows what a state-dependent decision consulted. **It is not a protected
  read at Screenplay 4.68.0:** nothing checks at append time that the state is still current,
  the executable model rejects `reads` and `concurrency` (`PLAY0271`), and adding
  `concurrency` does not make the decision safe (decision 0003, Screenplay #129).
  Write a state-dependent rule as `reads <View>` plus `require <expr> message "..."`
  and mark it in the slice `description` as **not enforced in the model today**,
  naming the target that must enforce it (Arc `[ProtectedDecision]` with
  `DecisionRead<T>`, Chronicle's dynamic consistency boundary, or a constraint where
  one fits). Model uniqueness as a `unique` constraint. Never copy state into a
  command input, add an attestation flag, or hide the rule in `handler` prose. Do not
  use `reads` to fetch data the command could carry as input. A reaction trigger
  declares the views an automation decides from with the same `reads`, and the same
  caveat applies.
- **Some validation *does* belong in the model.** The generic method routes format
  rules to the type system. Screenplay's type system *is* the `concept`, and a
  concept carries its own `validate` block - so a format rule lives on the concept
  and travels with every use. A state-dependent rule is not a format rule: it needs
  the modeled `reads` + `require` intent, specifications, and the recorded
  target-enforcement gap described above.


## Naming the primitives is the highest-value work

Name concepts before events, classify personal data at the concept, keep events past tense and single-purpose, and never put the event-source identity in an event payload.
Read [references/naming-primitives.md](references/naming-primitives.md) when declaring concepts, `@pii` classification, event shapes, `identifier`, inline events or `id "<old name>"` pins.

## Quick gate - before specifications are called done

Run this after the GWT specifications are written. **Do not proceed with gaps.**
When one is found, ask the user to clarify, create the missing element, re-validate.
The full critic pass (evidence, severity, business-question review) is
`cratis-screenplay-model-review`.

1. Every `readmodel` property traces to an `event` (**backward trace**).
2. Every `event` feeds a projection, reaction, or capture target (**forward trace**).
3. Every `command` has documented rejection conditions.
4. Every `reaction` has a termination condition and cannot loop forever.
5. No `given`/`when`/`then` clause references an undefined element.
6. Every behavior is exactly one slice type.
7. Read-model fields use collection types where the domain allows concurrent
   instances - ask *"can there be more than one of these at once?"* for each field.
8. No cross-cutting infrastructure is modeled as a `Translate` slice.


## Choose a file layout

Choose the coarsest layout that keeps source and diffs readable; compile the folder, or its root file, as one application, because compiling files individually reports false unknown-type errors (`PLAY0165`, `PLAY0166`, `PLAY0167`).
Read [references/file-layout.md](references/file-layout.md) when choosing or changing the file layout, writing `import` barrels, or compiling a split model.
