# Fast feedback is a product requirement

Applies to every Cratis repository and every application built on Cratis. A build and a spec run are
measured in seconds. Each line is tagged **[contract]** (binding) or **[convention]** (the house
default) per [`general.md`](../../../rules/general.md).

- **[contract] Building and running specs is as fast as possible, locally and in CI.** A change
  that makes a build or a spec run slower is a regression: measure it (cold full-suite wall time
  plus a focused single-folder loop) and fix it in the same change.
- **[contract] Every spec is safe to run in parallel with every other spec.** No shared mutable
  static state, no ordering assumptions, no fixed ports, paths or names that two specs could both
  claim. Never serialize a suite or opt out of shared setup to hide an isolation bug.
- **[contract] No per-spec startup cost for convenience.** Setup is built once and shared
  (shared lifecycle stays on). Slow setup in a framework harness is fixed in the framework and
  reported upstream; do not work around it by merging unrelated assertions or skipping specs.
- **[contract] Analyzers and generators are cheap or they are not added.** A slow one is an
  upstream issue; see [`framework.md`](./framework.instructions.md) for how analyzers are written for speed.
- **[convention] Specify with the cheapest proof that is real.** Call a pure decision directly;
  use the in-memory scenario helpers for slice behavior through the Arc/Chronicle pipeline, which
  cost milliseconds. The per-artifact table is in
  [`specs.scenarios.csharp.md`](./specs.scenarios.csharp.instructions.md); the universal base is in
  [`specs.md`](./specs.instructions.md).
- **[convention] Hosts, kernels, containers and browsers prove only contracts this repository
  owns:** storage format, wire protocol, migration, generated proxy or package, deploy image, or a
  real third-party integration. Never start one to re-prove Arc or Chronicle behavior. Build it once
  per class or collection, never per fact, and keep it out of the default pull-request lane unless
  that contract changed.
- **[contract] Consumer routing/e2e and service-boundary regression tests stay in the
  pull-request lane.** A consumer's test of its own routing, or of a boundary between its services,
  protects a contract the repository owns; the previous bullet is not a reason to move it off pull
  requests or retire it.
- **[contract] Retiring a consumer assertion needs a named upstream spec** in the owning
  repository that fails when the consumer behavior breaks. Without that mapping the assertion
  stays.

A cold full-suite run under a minute is the target for a repository's spec gate. It is a budget to
protect, not a reason to delete coverage.
